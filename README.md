# Ambient Forums by Michael Claus

Ambient forums is an online message board devoted to the discussion of ambient music.  It is a RESTfull app with full CRUD functionality.  It was one of the first full stack CRUD apps that I have built and was a huge learning process and step forward in my programming experience.  Once a user creates an accout, they can create new discussion posts as well as view what other people have posted and leave comments.  Users, comments, and posts models are all associated with each other and populated on page load.  It was one of the first times I had ever associated data with mongoose, which was a huge win for me.

# Code I'm Proud of

## Implementing Gulp and PostCSS
This was the first time I had ever used GULP with PostCSS.  It was an awesome experience and using GULP really took my css skills to the next level.  PostCSS includes some awesome functionality such as nested css and css variables.  Building with the two was a great experience and really opened my mind up to new build tools.
